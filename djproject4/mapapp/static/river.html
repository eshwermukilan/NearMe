        The Kollidam River, also known as Coleroon, is one of the important distributaries of the mighty Cauvery River in Tamil Nadu. Originating from the Grand Anicut (Kallanai) near Srirangam, the Kollidam branches off from the main Cauvery and flows eastward, eventually draining into the Bay of Bengal. Stretching over 150 kilometers, the river flows through several districts including Tiruchirappalli, Thanjavur, Cuddalore, and Chidambaram. It plays a crucial role in supporting agriculture along its banks, especially in the fertile delta regions, making it a lifeline for thousands of farmers. Apart from its agricultural value, the river holds cultural and historical significance too. During monsoons, the river swells with rainwater, creating a majestic and powerful flow, while in summer, its dry stretches are often used for sand mining and local transport. The scenic views of the Kollidam, especially near Chidambaram, offer a peaceful retreat for locals and visitors alike. It stands as a symbol of both natureâ€™s grace and its strength, nourishing the land and the people who depend on it.
